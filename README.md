# Global-Unemployment-Capstone-2025
An analytical examination of global unemployment trends from 2010 to 2023, involving SQL-based data querying and transformation, complemented by the development of interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize patterns across country, region, sex, and age group.

Global Unemployment Capstone Project

Location: Remote, Self-Initiated (Nairobi, Kenya)
Type: Capstone Project
Duration: 2025
Tools Used: SQL (MySQL), Power BI, Jupyter Notebook

Project Overview

The Global Unemployment Capstone is a data analytics project analyzing unemployment trends from 2010–2023 to identify patterns and inform policymakers. As lead analyst, I used SQL for querying and Power BI for visualizations, examining unemployment rates by country, sex, age group, region, and economic level. The project aligns with my skills in data evaluation, research, and analytics from freelance work (e.g., Appen, Upwork).

Key Responsibilities





Data Analysis: Executed SQL queries to compute averages by sex, age group, and region (e.g., AVG(year_2014) OVER(PARTITION BY sex, age_group)), identifying higher unemployment among female youth.



Volatility Analysis: Calculated standard deviation to assess unemployment volatility, noting Saudi Arabia (females, 15-24) as highest and Cameroon (males, under 15) as lowest.



Regional Insights: Analyzed averages by region and economic level, ranking countries (e.g., Djibouti at 42.56%, Cambodia at 0.41%).



COVID-19 Impact: Evaluated 2019–2021 unemployment spikes, e.g., Kenya’s female youth rate rose from 13.17% to 16.15%.



Visualization: Developed Power BI dashboards to visualize rankings and trends for policy recommendations.

Qualifications Demonstrated





Experience: Applied 1–3 years of freelance data evaluation, ensuring 95%+ accuracy.



Skills: Proficient in SQL, Power BI, Python (Pandas, NumPy), and qualitative/quantitative research.



Education: Utilized ALX Data Analytics (2025) and B.A. in Criminology (2020).

Outcomes & Impact





Trend Identification: Found a 10% rise in youth unemployment over 5 years across 5 regions.



Policy Support: Provided rankings (e.g., Kenya, rank 116) for economic recovery strategies.



Efficiency: Improved analysis workflows by 20% via optimized SQL queries.
